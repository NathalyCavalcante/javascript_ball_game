This project is part of the **"30 projects in 30 days"** Challenge from ðŸ’»[Rajasthani Coder](https://www.instagram.com/rajasthani_coder/) 
and ðŸ’»[Herin Bhatt](https://www.instagram.com/effective_dev/) that I intend to complete in order to improve my JavaScript skills. 
Despite that, I got the code through **ShawnJBeaton's** clear and easy explanations on his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX3gSJ43f7I&ab_channel=Rocketseat).
